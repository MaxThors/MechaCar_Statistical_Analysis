## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
According to our summary, when we look at the Pr(>|t|) values, the variables for vehicle length and ground clearance in addition to the intercept (MPG), are statistically
unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value of 5.35e-11 is much smaller
than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. We can now say that there is enough evidence to reject our null hypothesis and conclude that the slope of our inear model is not
zero. Looking at the r-squared value and p-value, we can conclude that the model is effective in predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
